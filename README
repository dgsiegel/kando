= fnut: A lightweight markup language =

fnut is a lightweight markup language along the lines of markdown,
textile, txt2tags, challis and others. I created it, as the named
implementations were too complicated, unflexible and unfriendly to
me.

== Usage ==

---
fnut.py [file]
---

== Syntax ==

All items are separated by at least one empty line. This counts for
paragraphs too.



Headers are marked with ``=`` and have to be closed.
Headers are possible up to level 6 (h6).

= Header level  1 =

== Header level 2 ==

=== Header level 3 ===

==== Header level 4 ====

===== Header level 5 =====

====== Header level 6 ======



Blockquotes start with at least 2 spaces.

  You can either just indent
the first line

  Or you can indent
  both lines



Code is inserted by adding a --- before and after the Blockquotes

---
this is a
     verbatim
code block
---



HTML can be inserted by just starting with a tag and will be ignored, e.g.

<div class="foo">
some content
</div>



Unordered lists are marked by -, ordered by + and the correct indentation.
They can be nested, but not together.

- first entry
  - second entry
    - third entry

+ first entry
  + second entry
    + third entry


The following german umlauts, special characters and latin characters will be
replaced by their equivalent HTML entities in both cases.

ÁÉÍÓÚáéíóú ÀÈÌÒÙàèìòù ÄËÏÖÜäëïöü ÂÊÎÔÛâêîôû ÃÕãõ ßÑñÇç



HTML special chars, like ``<``, ``>``, ``&`` and ``"`` are escaped with the
exception of already escaped chars, e.g. &copy;



A line break is done by using \\
A new line ;)



The following text formatting is possible:
** strong **
// italic //
-- strikethrough --
__ underline __
`` code ``



You can also have the text formatting over multiple lines:

This ** text will be bold, even
if there are multiple
lines in between **



The following link formats and image formats are possible

link: [http://www.example.org]
link with text: [some text http://www.example.org]
link with image: [http://example.org/files/image.jpg http://www.example.org]

image: [files/image.jpg]
image with alt text: [alt text files/image.jpg]
