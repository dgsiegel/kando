= kando: The "kan do" lightweight markup language =

kando is a very lightweight markup language along the lines of markdown,
textile, txt2tags, challis and others. I created it, as the named
implementations were too complicated, unflexible and unfriendly to me.

== Usage ==

---
kando.py [file]
---

== Syntax ==

All items are separated by at least one empty line. This counts for
paragraphs too.



Headers are marked with ``=`` and have to be closed.
Headers are possible up to level 6 (h6).

= Header level  1 =

== Header level 2 ==

=== Header level 3 ===

==== Header level 4 ====

===== Header level 5 =====

====== Header level 6 ======

======= Still level 6 header =======



Blockquotes start with at least 2 spaces.

  You can either just indent
the first line

  Or you can indent
  all lines

Or they can end with a cite

  This is a very important quote
  -- Random J. Person

Multiparagraph quotes can be done with two leading spaces marking a paragraph:

  This is a very important quote
  
  And this is the second part
  -- Random J. Person


Code is inserted by adding a --- before and after the Blockquotes

---
this is a
     verbatim
code block
---



HTML can be inserted by just starting with a tag and will be ignored, e.g.

<div class="foo">
some content
</div>

You can also do something funny like putting a parsed paragraph inside a div
like this:

<div style="text-align: center;">

This paragraph will be **parsed**

</div>

If you need to add classes to your div containers, use the following syntax

.myclass some content



Unordered lists are marked by -, ordered by + and the correct indentation.
They can be nested, but not together.

- first entry
  - second entry
    - third entry

+ first entry
  + second entry
    + third entry


The following german umlauts, special characters and latin characters will be
replaced by their equivalent HTML entities in both cases.

ÁÉÍÓÚáéíóú ÀÈÌÒÙàèìòù ÄËÏÖÜäëïöü ÂÊÎÔÛâêîôû ÃÕãõ ßÑñÇç



HTML special chars, like ``<``, ``>``, ``&`` and ``"`` will be escaped with the
exception of already escaped chars, e.g. &copy;



A line break is done by using \\
A new line ;)



The following text formatting is possible:
** strong **
// italic //
-- strikethrough --
__ underline __
`` code ``



You can also have the text formatting over multiple lines:

This ** text will be bold, even
if there are multiple
lines in between **



The following link formats and image formats are possible

link: [http://www.example.org]
link with text: [some text http://www.example.org]
link with image: [http://example.org/files/image.jpg http://www.example.org]

image: [files/image.jpg]
image with alt text: [alt text files/image.jpg]



Lines starting with # are ignored

# Ignored content
# and this line as well
